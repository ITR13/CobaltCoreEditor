# ITR'S COBALT CORE SHIP EDITOR

## READ THIS!
_**NB: WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FULLY FLESHED OUT YET**_  
Make sure you either have the game closed, or a different profile loaded before you import a shipmod!  

Each time you import a shipmod a backup will be created next to it. 
If the game breaks after importing, replace Save.json with the latest backup.
